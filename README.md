# Exploratory Data Analysis on Costa Rica household poverty using dataset from the InterAmerican Development Bank

This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) took a Kaggle competition dataset sponsored by the Inter-American Development Bank
(IADB) on predicting poverty levels amongst households in Costa Rica. The research idea is to identify
and explore those variables (household attributes or assets found in homes) to understand the data structure and underlying relationships in the data. 

# EXPLORATORY QUESTIONS
With the Kaggle data, some exploratory questions intended to be answered are:

- Might overcrowdedness in households impact poverty levels?

- Are there notable differences in household characteristics and poverty levels by region of the
country (or type of region: urban/rural)?

All scripts are written in Python.
